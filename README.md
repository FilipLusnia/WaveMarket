# WaveMarket

WaveMarket is an React app that visualises hidden Spotify song features.
With this app you can figure out:
* How long the song is
* What's the pace of the song
* Is the song loud
* What key and scale is song written in
* How much energy the given song has
* Will it make you sleep
* How happy the song is
* How much of a song is instrumental
* If there is a chance it's acoustic

It's simple as that - click a song and see the info in a pop-up window.

Data comes straight from [Spotify's API].

Project is built with [CRA]. 
Demo link avilable soon.

If you want to run it locally, `clone` this repo and type `npm start`.
